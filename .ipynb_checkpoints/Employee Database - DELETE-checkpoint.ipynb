    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You may hear the term \"Data Modeling\" in place of \"Data Engineering,\" but they are the same terms. Data Engineering is the more modern wording instead of Data Modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus \n",
    "\n",
    "As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas, but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) This step may require some research. Feel free to use the code below to get started. Be sure to make any necessary modifications for your username, password, host, port, and database name:\n",
